# AWS DeepRacer notebook using Amazon SageMaker for reinforcement learning (RL) and AWS RoboMaker services

This folder contains examples and resources for using Amazon SageMaker notebooks to train and evaluate AWS DeepRacer RL models. The example notebook provides a closer look at the architecture and services underpinning AWS DeepRacer and allows you to get under the hood and directly manipulate the code. In addition to training and evaluating models, you can also use the notebook to customize training and simulation environments.
