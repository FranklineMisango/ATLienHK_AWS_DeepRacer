    "# Training analysis for DeepRacer\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been built based on the `DeepRacer Log Analysis.ipynb` provided by the AWS DeepRacer Team. It has been reorganised and expanded to provide new views on the training data without the helper code which was moved into the [`deepracer-utils` library](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-utils).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether you're running your training through the console or using the local setup, and on which setup for local training you're using, your experience will vary. As much as I would like everything to be taylored to your configuration, there may be some problems that you may face. If so, please get in touch through [the AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start using the notebook, you will need to install some dependencies. If you haven't yet done so, have a look at [The README.md file](/edit/README.md#running-the-notebooks) to find what you need to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the install, you also have to configure your programmatic access to AWS. Have a look at the guides below, AWS resources will lead you by the hand:\n",
    "* AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\n",
    "* Boto Configuration: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html\n",

    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "* AWS DeepRacer Team for initial workbooks created for DeepRacer Workshops at Summits and re:Invent.\n",
    "* [CodeLikeAMother](https://codelikeamother.uk) for initial rework of the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original notebook has provided some great ideas on what could be visualised in the graphs. Below examples are a slightly extended version. Let's have a look at what they are presenting and what this may mean to your training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training progress\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have possibly noticed by now, training episodes are grouped into iterations and this notebook also reflects it. What also marks it are checkpoints in the training. After each iteration a set of ckpt files is generated - they contain outcomes of the training, then a model.pb file is built based on that and the car begins a new iteration. Looking at the data grouped by iterations may lead you to a conclusion, that some earlier checkpoint would be a better start for a new training. While this is limited in the AWS DeepRacer Console, with enough disk space you can keep all the checkpoints along the way and use one of them as a start for new training (or even as a submission to a race).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the episodes in a given iteration are a mixture of decision process and random guesses, mean results per iteration may show a specific trend. Mean values are accompanied by standard deviation to show the concentration of values around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rewards per Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see these values as lines or dots per episode in the AWS DeepRacer console. When the reward goes up, this suggests that a car is learning and improving with regards to a given reward function. **This does not have to be a good thing.** If your reward function rewards something that harms performance, your car will learn to drive in a way that will make results worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first the rewards just grow if the progress achieved grows. Interesting things may happen slightly later in the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The reward may go flat at some level - it might mean that the car can't get any better. If you think you could still squeeze something better out of it, review the car's progress and consider updating the reward function, the action space, maybe hyperparameters, or perhaps starting over (either from scratch or from some previous checkpoint)\n",
    "* The reward may become wobbly - here you will see it as a mesh of dots zig-zagging. It can be a gradually growing zig-zag or a roughly stagnated one. This usually means the learning rate hyperparameter is too high and the car started doing actions that oscilate around some local extreme. You can lower the learning rate and hope to step closer to the extreme. Or run away from it if you don't like it\n",
    "* The reward plunges to near zero and stays roughly flat - I only had that when I messed up the hyperparameters or the reward function. Review recent changes and start training over or consider starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard deviation says how close from each other the reward values per episode in a given iteration are. If your model becomes reasonably stable and worst performances become better, at some point the standard deviation may flat out or even decrease. That said, higher speeds usually mean there will be areas on track with higher risk of failure. This may bring the value of standard deviation to a higher value and regardless of whether you like it or not, you need to accept it as a part of fighting for significantly better times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not sure how useful this graph is. I would worry if it looked very similar to the reward graph - this could suggest that slower laps will be getting higher rewards. But there is a better graph for spotting that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Progress per Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph usually starts low and grows and at some point it will get flatter. The maximum value for progress is 100% so it cannot grow without limits. It usually shows similar initial behaviours to reward and time graphs. I usually look at it when I alter an action in training. In such cases this graph usually dips a bit and then returns or goes higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total reward per episode\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph has been taken from the original notebook and can show progress on certain groups of behaviours. It usually forms something like a triangle, sometimes you can see a clear line of progress that shows some new way has been first taught and then perfected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean completed lap times per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a model that completes laps reasonably often, we might want to know how fast the car gets around the track. This graph will show you that. I use it quite often when looking for a model to shave a couple more miliseconds. That said it has to go in pair with the last one:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completion rate per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents how big part of all episodes in an iteration is full laps. The value is from range [0, 1] and is a result of dividing amount of full laps in iteration by amount of all episodes in iteration. I say it has to go in pair with the previous one because you not only need a fast lapper, you also want a race completer.\n",
